    2. Accuracy - Is the information correct?
    3. Engagement - Is it interesting to read?
    4. Completeness - Does it cover the topic adequately?
    
    Rate the content on a scale of 1-10.
    
    If the content is excellent (rating 9+), respond with:
    "CONTENT APPROVED: [brief praise]"
    
    If improvement is needed (rating < 9), respond with:
    "REVISION NEEDED: [specific, actionable feedback]"
